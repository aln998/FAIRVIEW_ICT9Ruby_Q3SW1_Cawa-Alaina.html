<p><b> Genshin Impact is a game whose world consists of 7 countries, each being ruled by a god or in the game are referred to as "Archons." These 7 archons each possess the power to control the element each of them possess, Pyro, Cryo, Hydro, Electro, Anemo, Geo, and Dendro. They are also able to give "visions" which is the power to be able to control their element as well, this can be given by them to anyone. The story follows 2 traveler siblings, Aether and Lumine who are first seen in the game escaping their destroyed home Khaenri'ah. The Abyss is known to be an organization of beings that come from Khaenri'ah, which was destroyed during the Archon war about 500 years ago. Creatures and monsters from the Abyss are scattered everywhere in Teyvat, but the main villians or handlers of the organization aim to destroy or take revenge of the Archons. This is because of the Archons who destroyed Khaenri'ah, a world or region that was man-mad and was not ruled or governed by an Archon. While traveling through different universes and dimensions, they encountered an unknown god who battled them. This unknown god defeated both of them and took away Lumine, leaving the other sibling Aether behind. Aether was knocked out into a 500 year slumber in the world of Teyvat. He was awaken by a little floating creature Paimon, and now they both travel together across Teyvat seeking to find the powerful Archons for help, in search of his missing sibling Lumine.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b> Paimon is the one who wakes Aether, ending his never-ending slumber. Paimon hears out Aether's situation, and decides that they and the partner will be companions and they will act as Aether's guide to Teyvat. This may also be because Aether was woken up by the sounds of drowning Paimon in a lake, and Aether was near it so he fished Paimon out of the lake, saving them from drowning. As of now, Aether still hasn't found leading answers to find his sister, but he is still companions with Paimon. Actually, they have grown quite fond of each other, considering they are always together and have been through many hardships and battles. There are many rumors in the Genshin Impact community that suspect Paimon to be the unknown god that stole Lumine, since the design of Paimon is similar to that of the unknown god's, as well as Paimon's hometown is also unknown. Although these rumors, they have never been confirmed officially, and we may find out soon as the game progresses.</b></p>

<img align="left" src="aether.png" width="30%" height="27%">
<p align="center"><b> Aether is the male protagonist in the game lore, he is the main character. He is the sibling of Lumine, the stolen one by an unknwown god. During their fight, he and his sister both had lost their powers, and were unable to defeat the unknown god. Aether travels with Paimon in every region in Teyvat in search of his sister. In the game and lore, he comes across many people who seke help, mostly unrelated to his true goal. Mostly those who ask for his help require huge efforts, and they don't take no for an answer or are very assertive. He has come so far to his journey, not knowing whether he is close to his goal or not, and along his journey he was able to meet all sorts of beings, from mortals to even the Archons, and have battled with them. Because of this, he has earned the title of the infamous traveler. Aether is also able to manipulate many elements, even if he doesn't have a vision, which all the people in Teyvat know are to be needed in order to weild and manipulate a vision.  </b></p>

<p align="center"><b> Lumine is canonically the sibling who was taken away by the unknown god, for unknown reasons. As the story progresses, Aether, her brother, has encountered her a few times, and Lumine is always protected by, partnered with, or associated with the Abyss. Because the Abyss seeks to take revenge on the archons, the people know them to be evil. There is not a clear backstory however on how Lumine was made a princess of the Abyss, but all we know for sure is that she is part of it. It was said that during the 500 year slumber of Aether, Lumine traveled Teyvat like what Aether is currently doing, and she has seen the end of it. In one of the encounters of the two, Lumine mentions this and says that he is just doing the same thing he is doing now. Because of the journey, she has decided to join the Abyss. It was also discovered a few months ago in some cutscenes of the game that Lumine had been in some of them, proving her statement, "I am always watching."</b></p>
